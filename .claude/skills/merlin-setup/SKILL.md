name: merlin-setup
description: Use when no brand exists in assets/brands/ (first-run), the user says set up / onboard / add a new brand, the user wants to connect a platform (Meta, TikTok, Google, Shopify, Stripe, Klaviyo, Amazon, Discord, Slack, Etsy, Reddit, LinkedIn, Threads), or the user asks about scheduled tasks (merlin-daily, merlin-optimize, merlin-digest, merlin-memory). Covers website scrape, vertical detection, brand.md / memory.md scaffolding, WOW-moment product import, background competitor discovery, daily / optimize / digest / memory task creation, OAuth flows, Stripe read-only scope preference, and the "never ask for manual tokens" rule.
owner: ryan
bytes_justification: 38KB — setup is loaded only on first run per brand (rare), carries multi-step scheduled-task prompts that must stay verbatim, and halving it would force a second skill file and double-load on onboarding. Keep as one monolithic file.

# First-Run + Connection Setup

## Setup Flow

DO NOT print any ASCII art, banners, feature lists, or folder structure diagrams.
DO NOT narrate each setup step. The app has a native progress bar — do the work silently and show results (images, final summary). No play-by-play.

**The goal: WOW the user in 30 seconds.** Show their own content back to them — logo, products, images — in real time.

### A) Brand + Product setup

1. Ask: **"What's your brand's website?"** — the ONLY question. Everything else is automatic.

**VERTICAL AWARENESS** (after detecting vertical):
- **Ecommerce/DTC**: suggest Shopify connection, product import, ad creation.
- **SaaS/Software**: skip Shopify entirely. Focus on ad platforms (Meta/Google/TikTok), landing audits, blog/SEO, social. Products = features or plans.
- **Agency/Service**: skip Shopify. Focus on lead-gen ads, landing pages, email.
- NEVER suggest "import from Shopify" for non-ecommerce brands — it confuses users.

2. **Do all of this silently — no step narration, just show results:**

   **Brand + Colors + Voice:**
   - Fetch the website, extract brand name, download logo.
   - READ the logo so it displays inline in chat.
   - Extract brand colors from CSS, detect voice tone, identify target audience.
   - Write `brand.md` with: brand name, URL, vertical, brand colors (exact hex), voice tone, audience demographics, CTA style, tagline.
   - Write `memory.md` in the same brand folder with this template:
     ```
     # [Brand Name] — Memory

     ## Run Log
     <!-- Format: YYYY-MM-DD | product | mode | model | pass/fail | takeaway -->

     ## What Works

     ## What Fails

     ## Monthly Spend

     ## MER Trend

     ## Competitor Signals

     ## Errors
     ```

   **Products — THE WOW MOMENT:**
   - Fetch `<website>/products.json` — if this works, it's a Shopify store. Save the `.myshopify.com` domain to config immediately:
     - Check response headers or follow redirects to find `X-ShopId` or `.myshopify.com` redirect.
     - Run: `curl -sI <website> | grep -i 'myshopify\|x-shopid\|shopify'` to detect.
     - If found, note the Shopify store name for the connect step later. Enables instant Shopify OAuth (no resolution step).
   - For each of the first 10 products:
     - Create product folder + download first image.
     - **READ the downloaded image so it appears inline.**
     - Show: `**[Product Name]** — $[price]` with image visible.
   - Download remaining images (up to 5 per product) in the background.
   - Launch a **background Agent** to generate `product.md` for each product silently.

   **IMPORTANT:** Use Read on each downloaded image so it renders inline. Path: `assets/brands/<brand>/products/<product>/references/1.jpg` — Read immediately after download.

   If `/products.json` doesn't work:
   - Try scraping product pages directly.
   - If that fails: "I couldn't auto-pull products from your site. Drop some product photos in and I'll take it from there."

   **Competitors (background):** launch a background agent to find 5–8 via WebSearch. Write `assets/brands/<brand>/competitors.md`.

   **Automation (automatic — don't ask):** create all four scheduled tasks automatically (daily, optimize, digest, memory).

   **Final summary (the ONLY setup message after products):**
   ```
   [Brand] is loaded — [X] products, [Y] reference photos. Autopilot is on.

   Want to supercharge your results? Drop any of these into your brand folder:

   Your best-performing ads -> assets/brands/[brand]/quality-benchmark/
   A voice sample (.mp3/.wav) -> assets/brands/[brand]/voices/
   Creator photos/videos -> assets/brands/[brand]/avatars/

   What would you like to create first?
   ```

   **Rules for the summary:** show ONCE per brand, first setup only · use the actual brand name + folder path · skip lines for folders already populated · always end with "What would you like to create first?"

### B) Schedule daily generation (created automatically)

Create all four scheduled tasks without asking. Use `mcp__scheduled-tasks__create_scheduled_task`. All `taskId`s must use the `merlin-` prefix.

#### Task 1 — `merlin-daily` (daily content)

- **cronExpression:** `0 9 * * 1-5` (9 AM weekdays)
- **description:** `Generate daily content for all brands`
- **prompt:**
  ```
  == SETUP ==
  Check connection status via mcp__merlin__connection_status.
  Use MCP tools for all platform actions.

  == ERROR HANDLING (applies to ALL steps) ==
  If the app returns an error or non-zero exit code:
    - Log the error to assets/brands/<brand>/memory.md under "## Errors"
    - Post to Slack + Discord if configured: "✦ Merlin error: {error message}"
    - Skip that step and continue to the next
    - Do NOT retry failed API calls — they will be retried next cycle
  If a token/API key error occurs (401, 403, "unauthorized", "expired"):
    - Log: "⚠ TOKEN EXPIRED: {platform}" to assets/brands/<brand>/memory.md
    - Post to Slack: "✦ ⚠ {platform} token expired — re-authenticate to resume"
    - Skip ALL steps for that platform until the next session

  == MEMORY ROTATION ==
  The merlin-memory spell handles weekly compaction. During daily runs, just append.
  Only intervene if memory.md is over 300 lines (emergency): delete oldest Run Log entries until under 200.

  == MULTI-BRAND ==
  Scan assets/brands/ for all brand folders (skip "example").
  For EACH brand that has products:

  1. Read brand.md + assets/brands/<brand>/memory.md. Pick a product not used in the last 7 days (check Run Log).
     If all products were used recently, pick the one with the longest gap.

  2. Generate a product-showcase image (both formats).
     If quality gate fails after 3 retries, log failure and move on.
     Post to Slack if configured.

  3. If shopifyStore + shopifyAccessToken are configured:
     - Write a 600-1000 word SEO blog post about the product
     - Use the brand voice from brand.md
     - Check CONFIG.blogPublishMode:
       - If "draft": publish as draft via {"action": "blog-post", ..., "draft": true}
       - If "published" or missing: publish live
     - Log the blog title + URL + publish status in assets/brands/<brand>/memory.md

  4. SEO fix queue — if assets/brands/<brand>/seo.md exists:
     - Fix 2-3 images with EMPTY alt text (seo-fix-alt action)
     - Mark each fixed item as [x] in seo.md
     - NEVER touch: product titles, descriptions, prices, pages, theme
     - NEVER overwrite existing alt text

  5. Calendar-driven content (if Shopify connected):
     - Run {"action":"calendar"} to get launch predictions + upcoming gaps
     - If a product launch or seasonal event is within 7 days:
       → Prioritize that product for today's creative generation (override rotation)
       → Draft a blog post timed to the event
       → Log: "Calendar: {event} in {N} days — prepped {product} content"
     - If no launches for 14+ days: generate evergreen content for best-performing product

  6. Review solicitation (if Shopify + Klaviyo configured):
     - Run {"action":"shopify-orders","batchCount":7} to find orders fulfilled 5-7 days ago
     - For each fulfilled order (max 3/day to avoid spam):
       → Create a Klaviyo campaign draft: product photo + "How are you liking your {product}?" + review link
       → Publish as draft — user or merlin-optimize can approve
       → Log: "Review request drafted for {product} (order {id})"
  ```
- After creation tell user: *"Daily content is set! I'll generate fresh ads and blog drafts every weekday at 9 AM."*

#### Task 2 — `merlin-optimize` (only if Meta OR TikTok configured)

- **cronExpression:** `0 10 * * 1-5` (10 AM weekdays, 1h after generation)
- **description:** `Agency-tier ad optimization: kill losers, scale winners, manage budget`
- **prompt:**
  ```
  == SETUP ==
  Check connection status via mcp__merlin__connection_status.
  Use MCP tools for all platform actions.
  DAILY_BUDGET = CONFIG.dailyAdBudget (default $20 if not set)

  Derive all thresholds from DAILY_BUDGET — never hardcode:
    MONTHLY_CAP = DAILY_BUDGET × 30
    TESTING_BUDGET = DAILY_BUDGET × 0.60 (60% for testing new creatives)
    SCALING_BUDGET = DAILY_BUDGET × 0.30 (30% for proven winners)
    RETARGETING_BUDGET = DAILY_BUDGET × 0.10 (10% for retargeting warm audiences)
    PER_AD_TEST_BUDGET = max($5, TESTING_BUDGET ÷ active_test_count)

  == TOKEN VALIDATION ==
  Before any platform action, verify tokens work:
  For each configured platform (Meta, TikTok, Google, Amazon):
    - Try a lightweight read call (e.g., meta-insights with batchCount:1)
    - If 401/403: Log "⚠ TOKEN EXPIRED: {platform}" to activity.jsonl
    - Skip ALL actions for that platform in this run
    - Do NOT retry — user must re-authenticate

  == ERROR HANDLING ==
  Same rules as merlin-daily task: log errors, alert on token expiry, skip and continue.

  == STEP 1: BUDGET PACING CHECK ==
  Read assets/brands/<brand>/memory.md "## Monthly Spend" section.
  Calculate: days_elapsed = days since 1st of month, days_remaining = days until end of month
  Expected pace = MONTHLY_CAP × (days_elapsed / days_in_month)
  Actual spend = sum of all spend entries this month

  If actual > expected × 1.2: OVERPACING — reduce today's actions (skip new ad creation, only optimize existing)
  If actual < expected × 0.5: UNDERPACING — increase today's actions (create extra test ads if budget allows)
  Log: "Budget pacing: $X spent / $Y expected ($Z cap). Status: ON_PACE / OVERPACING / UNDERPACING"

  If actual >= MONTHLY_CAP: STOP all ad operations. Post to Slack + Discord: "✦ Monthly budget cap reached."

  == STEP 1b: LOAD RECENT HISTORY ==
  Read the last 30 lines of assets/brands/<brand>/activity.jsonl to understand recent actions.
  Avoid duplicating work (don't kill an ad just created yesterday,
  don't queue a replacement for a product that already got one today).
  Read assets/brands/<brand>/ads-live.json for current live ad state.

  == STEP 2: PULL PERFORMANCE (all platforms) ==
  For each configured platform (Meta, TikTok, Google):
    Run insights action. Collect for every ad:
    - ad_id, ad_name, status, spend, impressions, clicks, CTR, CPC, purchases, revenue, ROAS
    - days_running
    - ctr_trend (today's CTR vs first 48h average)

  == STEP 3: TRIAGE EVERY AD (agency decision framework) ==
  For EACH active ad, apply these rules IN ORDER:

  SAFETY RULE — AGGREGATE KILL CAP:
    Count total active ads before triage. In a single optimization run,
    NEVER kill more than 50% of active ads. If triage rules would kill
    more than 50%, only kill the worst performers up to the 50% cap.
    Log: "Kill cap reached: {killed}/{total} ads (50% limit). Spared {N} borderline ads."

  SAFETY RULE — DUPLICATE PREVENTION:
    Before creating any new test ad, check ads-live.json for the same brand.
    If an ad already exists for the same product with the same hook style,
    do NOT create a duplicate.

  WRITE-BACK RULE — After EVERY kill, scale, or publish:
    Update ads-live.json immediately. Set status to "paused" for kills, "live" for scales/publishes.
    Update ROAS and budget fields from the latest insights data.

  RULE 1 — DEAD ON ARRIVAL (kill fast, save money):
    If spent >= 2× PER_AD_TEST_BUDGET AND purchases == 0 AND CTR < 1.0%:
    → KILL immediately. Don't waste another dollar.
    → Reason: "Dead on arrival: ${spent} spent, 0 purchases, {CTR}% CTR after {days} days"

  RULE 2 — LOW PERFORMER:
    If spent >= PER_AD_TEST_BUDGET AND ROAS < 0.5 AND days_running >= 2:
    → KILL. Fair shot, underperformed.

  RULE 3 — CREATIVE FATIGUE:
    If days_running >= 5 AND ctr_trend declining 30%+ from peak:
    → KILL. Add to memory: "Hook style '{hook}' fatigued after {days} days for {product}."
    → Queue a replacement with DIFFERENT hook.

  RULE 4 — PROMISING:
    If days_running < 3 AND CTR >= 1.0%: HOLD.

  RULE 5 — WINNER:
    If ROAS >= 1.5 AND days_running >= 2 AND spend >= PER_AD_TEST_BUDGET:
    → SCALE. Duplicate to Scaling campaign with budget = SCALING_BUDGET ÷ active_winners.
    → Add to memory "## What Works".

  RULE 6 — MASSIVE WINNER:
    If ROAS >= 3.0 AND spend >= DAILY_BUDGET AND purchases >= 5:
    → SCALE + create LOOKALIKE from purchasers. ONCE per ad (check memory.md for "lookalike:{ad_id}").

  RULE 7 — RETARGET:
    If any WINNER exists AND retargeting has no active ads:
    → Create retargeting ad with winner's creative, pixel audience. Budget = RETARGETING_BUDGET.
    → Emphasize urgency/social proof, not awareness.

  == STEP 4: CREATIVE PIPELINE (replace killed ads) ==
  For each killed ad, if TESTING_BUDGET has room:
  → Queue new test ad with different hook / format / angle.
  → Read memory.md "## What Works"/"## What Fails" to avoid repeats.
  → merlin-daily will generate tomorrow.

  == STEP 5: CROSS-PLATFORM INTELLIGENCE ==
  If multiple platforms active, compare ROAS per product per platform.
  Shift 20% from underperformer to winner within DAILY_BUDGET cap.

  == STEP 5b: PREDICTIVE BUDGET REALLOCATION ==
  Week-over-week ROAS drops ≥30% → reduce loser 30%, increase winner same.
  Never below $5/day, never above DAILY_BUDGET total.

  == STEP 5c: INVENTORY-AWARE AD PAUSING ==
  If Shopify connected: shopify-products → if inventory ≤ 0, pause ads promoting that product.
  Restock → re-enable ads that were paused for stock.

  == STEP 5d: WINNER FORMULA DETECTION ==
  After 4+ tests, identify (hook + format + audience + time-of-day) that outperforms 2×+.
  Log to memory "## What Works": "WINNING FORMULA: ..."

  == STEP 5e: FATIGUE CURVE PREDICTION ==
  For ads 3+ days old: if CTR dropped 20%+ from peak, predict fatigue day.
  If within 3 days: queue replacement now.

  == STEP 5f: CROSS-PLATFORM ARBITRAGE ==
  ROAS drop 30%+ on one platform while another rose 30%+ → check wisdom for vertical trend.

  == STEP 5g: COMPETITOR ACTIVITY SURGE ==
  If Meta + competitors.md: competitor-scan top 3 (max 3/day). If any launched 3×+ normal volume in 72h, flag.

  == STEP 6: DAILY DASHBOARD SNAPSHOT ==
  mcp__merlin__dashboard({action: "dashboard", brand: "X", batchCount: 1}) → results/dashboard_YYYY-MM-DD.json.
  Monthly (1st only): mcp__merlin__shopify({action: "cohorts", brand: "X", batchCount: 180}).

  == STEP 6b: CHURN-TRIGGERED WIN-BACK ==
  Monthly (1st week): if any 90-day cohort repeat rate < 15%:
    → email-audit: does win-back flow exist? If no → flag. If yes but churn rising → recommend refresh.

  == STEP 7: SAVE MEMORY (do this FIRST before posting) ==
  Update assets/brands/<brand>/memory.md:
    - "## Monthly Spend": today's spend by platform
    - "## Run Log": date, ads killed/scaled/created, budget pacing
    - "## What Works" / "## What Fails": new patterns
    - "## MER Trend": today's MER from dashboard

  Write per-brand briefing.json AND root .merlin-briefing.json:
    {"date":"YYYY-MM-DD","ads":{"killed":N,"scaled":N,"created":N,"active":N},"content":{"blogs":N,"images":N},"revenue":{"total":"$X","trend":"+Y%"},"bestHookStyle":"ugc","bestFormat":"9:16","avgROAS":X.X,"recommendation":"..."}

  == STEP 8: POST + LOG ==
  Post to Slack + Discord:
    "✦ Daily Optimization — {brand}
    MER: {X}x | Revenue: ${rev} | Spend: ${spent_today}
    Budget: ${spent_today} / ${DAILY_BUDGET} daily | ${month_total} / ${MONTHLY_CAP} monthly
    Killed: {N} (reasons: {brief})
    Scaled: {N} (best: {top_ad_name} at {ROAS}x)
    Replacements queued: {N}
    Pacing: {ON_PACE / OVERPACING / UNDERPACING}"

  If no actions taken: "✓ All ads performing normally — no changes needed"
  ```

#### Task 3 — `merlin-digest` (weekly digest, always)

- **cronExpression:** `0 9 * * 1` (Monday 9 AM)
- **description:** `Weekly performance digest across all brands and platforms`
- **prompt:**
  ```
  == ERROR HANDLING ==
  Same rules as other tasks: log errors, skip failed steps, continue.

  == MULTI-BRAND ==
  Scan assets/brands/ for all brand folders (skip "example"). Report on ALL brands.

  == ADS (if Meta or TikTok configured) ==
  1. Meta-insights, collect all campaign data
  2. TikTok-insights, collect all campaign data
  3. Errors → note in digest and continue

  == SEO (per brand, if Shopify configured) ==
  4. {"action": "blog-list"} → this week's posts
  5. Read seo.md — completed [x] vs remaining [ ]
  6. Read memory.md for blog URLs this week

  == COMPETITOR INTEL (per brand, if competitors.md) ==
  7. Read competitors.md
  8. If metaAccessToken: competitor-scan
  9. WebSearch for competitor news

  == COMPILE DIGEST ==
  ✦  Merlin Weekly Digest — [Date Range]
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  BUDGET: Monthly spend $XX / $YY cap (ZZ%). Remaining: $XX.
  ADS:
    META: Spend $XX | ATC XX | ROAS X.Xx | Best: [ad] | Worst: [ad]
    TIKTOK: Spend $XX | ATC XX | Active: X testing, X scaling
    Actions: X killed, X scaled, X retargeted
  SEO: X posts published (Y draft). X alt fixes. Queue: X.
  COMPETITORS: [notable findings]
  CONTENT: Images X | Videos X

  == COMPETITOR RESPONSE ==
  Competitor 3×+ surge → "⚠ {competitor} launched {N} ads. Hooks: {top hooks}. Counter-creative?"
  Sale/offer → "COMPETITIVE PRESSURE — consider matching."
  Save trending hooks to memory "## Competitor Hooks".

  == PRICING INSIGHTS (if Shopify) ==
  shopify-analytics 30d. Cross AOV with ad ROAS:
    High ROAS + Low AOV → underpriced (room to raise)
    Low ROAS + High AOV → overpriced (test lower or bundle)
    High ROAS + High AOV → sweet spot
  Per-product: ATC-to-purchase < 50% avg → possible price friction.

  == CUSTOMER HEALTH (1st week only, if Shopify) ==
  shopify-cohorts 180d: repeat rate trend, LTV by cohort.
    <20% repeat → "⚠ Low repeat — win-back + post-purchase critical"
    LTV up → "Strategy is building loyalty"

  10. Post to Slack + Discord
  11. Update memory.md with weekly summary
  ```

#### Task 4 — `merlin-memory` (memory hygiene, always)

- **cronExpression:** `0 23 * * 0` (Sunday 11 PM, off-peak)
- **description:** `Keep brand memory files clean and within token budget`
- **prompt:**
  ```
  Scan assets/brands/ for all brand folders (skip "example").
  For EACH brand, read memory.md and enforce caps:

  SECTION CAPS (count entries, delete oldest beyond cap):
    "## Run Log": keep last 50
    "## What Works": keep last 20
    "## What Fails": keep last 20
    "## Monthly Spend": keep last 6 months
    "## Errors": keep last 20
    "## MER Trend": keep last 30
    "## Competitor Signals": keep last 10
    "## Customer Health": keep last 6
    "## Competitor Hooks": keep last 10

  TARGET: memory.md under 200 lines total.
  If still over 200 after caps, reduce each section proportionally.

  Do NOT summarize old entries — delete them. Recent data has signal.
  Log: "Memory cleanup: {brand} — {before} lines → {after} lines"
  ```

### C) Platform connections (don't ask during setup — connect on demand)

When the user later asks to publish ads / connect Shopify / etc., use one-click OAuth:

- Meta: `platform_login({platform: "meta", brand})` **— EXCEPT Meta is currently in App Review, so OAuth unavailable.** Tell users to click the Meta tile in Connections and paste their token from `developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer`. Do NOT use `platform_login` for Meta.
- TikTok / Shopify / Google / Amazon / Etsy / Reddit / Discord / Slack / Stripe: `platform_login({platform: "X", brand})` — browser OAuth, one click, token exchanged via Worker BFF.

**CRITICAL: OAuth timeout.** The app waits up to 5 minutes for in-browser authorization. Any Bash call running an OAuth action MUST set `timeout: 300000`. Default 120s kills before the user finishes.

**When connecting any ad platform**, ask ONE question: *"How much do you want to spend per day on ads? (e.g., $20, $50, $100)"*

Merlin infers everything from `dailyAdBudget`:
- Monthly cap = daily × 30
- Testing = 60% (split across test ads)
- Scaling = 30% (winners only)
- Retargeting = 10%
- Per-ad test = Testing ÷ active test count (min $5)
- Kill threshold = 2× per-ad with 0 purchases → kill
- Scale threshold = ROAS > 1.5× after 48h → promote
- Fatigue threshold = CTR drops 30%+ from peak over 3 days → kill + replace

Default: **$20/day** if the user doesn't answer (enough for 3–4 ads at $5 each).

Always say: *"You can change this anytime — just say 'change my daily budget to $X'."*

**NEVER ask for tokens, IDs, or keys manually. NEVER fall back to "go to Business Settings → System Users → Generate Token." If OAuth fails, tell the user to try again — do NOT switch to manual token instructions. If OAuth isn't available for a platform yet, say so clearly.**

### E) Shopify connection

One-click OAuth via `platform_login({platform: "shopify", brand})`:
- App auto-resolves store name from brand website.
- Opens Shopify OAuth approval.
- User clicks "Install" — one click.
- Token exchanged automatically.

**NEVER ask users to create custom apps, copy tokens, or navigate Shopify admin settings.**

After connecting:
1. **Auto-import products:** `{"action": "shopify-import"}`.
2. **Pull order metrics:** `{"action": "shopify-orders", "batchCount": 7}`.
3. Launch a background SEO audit (see below).

### F) Stripe connection (optional — revenue reporting)

Offer when the brand is SaaS / subscription / non-Shopify commerce, or when the user mentions MRR / churn / ARR / subscriptions.

Stripe is **read-only** — scope pinned to `read_only`, enforced at 3 layers (source scan, Worker BFF scope check, Stripe's own 403 on writes). Merlin can see revenue, subscriptions, cohorts — but cannot charge, refund, cancel, modify.

One-click OAuth: `platform_login({platform: "stripe", brand})` → `https://connect.stripe.com/oauth/authorize?scope=read_only&...` → user clicks "Connect" → token exchanged via Worker BFF (client secret never touches user's machine).

After connecting:
1. **Verify account:** `{"action": "stripe-setup"}` → confirm connection, cache account ID.
2. **Pull revenue:** `{"action": "stripe-revenue", "batchCount": 30}` — gross, refunds, net, AOV, new customers, USD-normalized via Stripe's FX.
3. **Pull subscription metrics:** `{"action": "stripe-subscriptions"}` — MRR, ARR, active subs, 30-day churn, top plans. Returns nil for transactional-only merchants.

**Revenue source disambiguation (CRITICAL):** if BOTH Shopify AND Stripe connected AND Stripe processes Shopify → double-count. First `stripe-setup` after connecting both prints a prompt. Ask user, then run:
```
{"action": "stripe-preference", "provider": "shopify"}   # Shopify topline, Stripe hidden
{"action": "stripe-preference", "provider": "stripe"}    # Stripe topline, Shopify hidden
{"action": "stripe-preference", "provider": "both"}      # Separate streams, sum them
```
Default (no preference) prefers Shopify — safer, avoids double-count.

## Background SEO Audit

### NON-NEGOTIABLE: What Merlin NEVER touches

```
NEVER modify:
  - Product titles, descriptions, prices, variants, sizes, inventory
  - Collection pages or descriptions
  - Theme files, Liquid templates, CSS, JS
  - Navigation menus or page structure
  - Homepage content
  - Anything the store owner may have written or customized

The store owner set these intentionally. Do NOT "improve" them.
```

### What Merlin CAN do (additive-only, non-breaking)

```
ALLOWED:
  - Publish NEW blog posts (new content, never edits)
  - Add image alt text WHERE CURRENTLY EMPTY (never overwrite existing)
  - Report sitemap/robots.txt issues (report only, never modify)
  - Identify content gap opportunities (blog topics, not product changes)
  - Report Google indexing/presence findings (informational)
```

Audit by fetching: homepage (title/meta/H1, report only) · `/products.json` (flag empty alt text — fixable, count products) · `/blogs/news` (exists? post count? recency) · `/sitemap.xml` (exists + accessible, report only) · `/robots.txt` (check for accidental blocks, report only).

Write findings to `assets/brands/<brand>/seo.md`:

```markdown
# SEO Audit — <Brand Name>
Audited: YYYY-MM-DD | Store: <url>

```

### After each scheduled task completes

Check if `assets/brands/brands-index.json` exists. If not, regenerate by scanning `assets/brands/` (excluding `example`) and writing the index with each brand's name, vertical, status, productCount. Lightweight — only write if missing.

## Folder Structure

```
assets/brands/
└── <brand>/                    ← brand folder (e.g., "madchill")
    ├── brand.md                ← voice, audience, CTA style, brand colors
    ├── memory.md               ← what works/fails, run log, MER trend
    ├── briefing.json           ← latest ROAS, best hook/format, active ads
    ├── competitors.md          ← auto-discovered competitors
    ├── seo.md                  ← SEO audit (if Shopify connected)
    ├── quality-benchmark/      ← S-tier ad examples (user drops these)
    ├── voices/                 ← voice samples (.mp3/.wav)
    ├── avatars/                ← creator faces/videos
    └── products/
        └── <product>/          ← e.g., "full-zip"
            ├── references/     ← product photos (auto-pulled)
            └── product.md      ← auto-generated

## Detection Logic

1. **List brands** — scan `assets/brands/` for subdirs with `brand.md`.
2. **List products** — scan `assets/brands/<brand>/products/` for subdirs with `references/`.
3. **Route from user input:**
   - `/merlin cream-set video` → find which brand contains `cream-set`, use it.
   - `/merlin madchill pink-set images` → explicit brand + product.
   - `/merlin make a video` → if only one brand+product, use it. Ambiguous → ask.
4. **No brand exists** → run Setup Flow above.

## Auto-generate `product.md`

When a product folder has `references/` but no `product.md`:
1. Read all images in `<brand>/<product>/references/`.
2. Write:
```markdown
# [Product Name]   (from folder name, Title Case)
- **Type**: [hoodie, joggers, set, etc. — from photos]
- **Colors**: [what you see]
- **Key details**: [stitching, fabric, fit, logo placement — what you see]
- **Vibe**: [casual, premium, sporty, etc.]
```

## Auto-generate `brand.md`

On first run with a new brand, ask for the website URL and scrape. Detect channel signals:
- **Store locator / "Find a store" page** → `channels:retail,online`
- **Single location** → `channels:retail,online` + `locations:1`
- **No physical store signals** → `channels:online`

If unsure, ask: *"Do you have a physical store or is this online-only?"* (affects ad targeting).

## Routing hints

- "set up / onboard / add brand X" / no brands exist → run Setup Flow (section A)
- "connect Meta / TikTok / Google / Shopify / Stripe / Klaviyo / Amazon / Discord / Slack / Etsy / Reddit / LinkedIn / Threads" → `platform_login` (section C, exception for Meta)
- "change daily budget to $X" → config write via `mcp__merlin__config`
- "what scheduled tasks are running" → `mcp__scheduled-tasks__list_scheduled_tasks`
- "turn off daily / optimize / digest" → `mcp__scheduled-tasks__update_scheduled_task({taskId, enabled: false})`
