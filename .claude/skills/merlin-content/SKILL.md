bytes_justification: 26KB — the creative brief (7 locks × 7 ad-type modules × negative-anchor library × realism gradient × video technical anchors), offer construction (Value Equation + Schwartz awareness levels + 5 DR frameworks), creative performance metrics (hook/hold/thumbstop with beat structure), copy quality gate, and content scoring form one linked reasoning chain. Splitting by asset type would duplicate the shared brief/scoring sections and break cross-references (e.g. UGC brief references the realism gradient which references continuity locks; offer construction references hook archetypes which reference Copy Quality Gate). Hard-capped at 32KB.

# Content Production — Images, Video, Copy

**Customers buy what they see in the ad. If the ad doesn't match the product, it's deceptive — non-negotiable.**

## Image Prompts (`mcp__merlin__content({action: "image"})`)

Before writing ANY image prompt:
1. **Read every reference photo** in `assets/brands/<brand>/products/<product>/references/` (use the Read tool).
2. **Describe ONLY what you see** — not what `brand.md` says, not what you imagine.
3. The app validates your description against reference images and rejects mismatches.

Pass the raw product description to the image action; the app's prompt pipeline layers camera settings, scene anchoring, and negative constraints automatically. Available models: `banana-pro-edit` (default), `banana-pro`, `banana-edit`, `imagen-ultra`, `ideogram`, `flux`. Omit `imageModel` unless the user explicitly requests one.

**Model substitution is a hard failure.** Seedance ≠ Kling, Veo ≠ anything else, image-to-video ≠ text-to-video, edit ≠ base. If the requested model fails/rate-limits/isn't mapped — STOP, surface the binary error, ask. Silent retries on a different model is a bug.

**Fal known aliases (pass as-is, NEVER WebFetch to verify):** `banana`, `banana-edit`, `banana-pro`, `banana-pro-edit`, `flux`, `ideogram`, `recraft`, `seedream`, `imagen`, `imagen-ultra`, `seedance-2`, `veo-3`, `kling`. Full `fal-ai/vendor/model` slugs also accepted. Only WebFetch if a name is neither an alias nor a full slug.

## Universal Creative Brief — the 7 locks (required for every image/video prompt)

Every S-tier prompt is a constraint pyramid — top-down specificity beats top-down creativity. Any prompt that ships without all 7 gets rejected at QA. Output order matters — models weight the opening heavier than the middle.

1. **Shell lock** — one opener line declaring: generation mode (`Pure text generation` vs `Image-to-video from reference`), aspect/format (`Vertical 9:16`, `Square 1:1`, `Landscape 16:9`), duration (`15-second seamless`), stylistic family (`handheld phone-camera UGC vlog`, `hero product cinematic`, `screen-recording SaaS demo`). No ambiguity. This line alone filters 80% of model drift.
2. **Subject lock** — who/what appears, with specific physical/SKU anchors, followed by the literal phrase **"same [subject] throughout — only [allowed variable] changes"**. People: age range + skin tone + hair + build. Products: SKU name + color + material + packaging. Prevents face morphing and product swapping across beats.
3. **Beat blocking** — timestamped sections (`0–4s`, `5–9s`, `10–14s`, `15s`). Each beat specifies all of: setting, lighting, wardrobe/packaging state, camera framing, camera motion, subject action, subject emotion, voiceover (with emotion tag), ambient audio. Skip none.
4. **Evolution spec** (transformation ads only) — explicit `Stage 1 / Stage 2 / Stage 3` paragraph stating what visibly changes and by how much. Concrete visible deltas ("redness faint → reduced → gone"), not abstractions.
5. **Camera grammar** — per-beat angle + motion + lens feel. UGC: "handheld selfie, slightly shaky, phone-camera lens." Hero: "locked tripod, slow dolly-in, 50mm-equivalent." SaaS: "static screen capture, cursor motion only."
6. **Audio map** — per-beat ambient layer (`tap dripping faintly`, `fabric rustle`, `keyboard clicks`), plus explicit music directive: `No background music` OR `soft lo-fi bed at -18dB`. Silence about music produces stock-library slop.
7. **Negative anchor list** — final block titled `No:` listing exact failure modes (see Negative Anchor Library). Model compliance with a list is dramatically higher than with prose prohibitions.

**Style summary line** — after the 7 locks, add one comma-delimited adjective stack (`vertical 9:16, raw handheld vlog, natural light only, phone-camera feel, real skin texture, warm tones, 4K`). This is the model's "final pass" reference.

**Freeze-frame close-out** — for video, last 1s MUST be an explicit final-frame spec: what's in frame, lighting, focus, subject expression. Prevents trailing off into blur.

## Ad-Type Modules (pick ONE; compose with the 7 locks)

Each module = realism register + camera family + audio family + canonical negative anchors. Merlin picks the module from `product.md` + user intent, then fills in the 7 locks.

**UGC / Authenticity** (skincare, supplements, apparel, DTC staples)
- Realism register: **raw, unfiltered, real skin texture**. Tokens per beat: `pores visible`, `no filter`, `real skin texture`, `phone-camera feel`.
- Camera: handheld, selfie angle, slight shake, FaceTime tilt, 1–2 ft subject distance.
- Audio: ambient-only or quiet room tone, voiceover `naturally, casually, not scripted-sounding`, emotion tag before every line (`tired, honest`, `surprised, quieter`, `warm, confident`).
- Wardrobe progression: same person, outfit shifts across beats to imply time.
- Banned: studio lighting, ring lights, color grading, bokeh, glam makeup, posed smiles, cinematic moves.

**Hero Product / Cinematic** (luxury, tech, packaged goods, premium beverages)
- Realism register: **controlled, heightened, tactile**. Product reads like reference photo at 2× gloss.
- Camera: locked tripod or motion-controlled slider, slow dolly-in, macro pulls on texture, 50/85mm feel.
- Audio: designed soundscape — soft foley for material, optional cinematic bed at -20dB, no voiceover unless premium narrator.
- Lighting: three-point or single-key with negative fill, specular highlights on product edges.
- Banned: handheld shake, phone-camera aesthetic, lens flare presets, vlog language.

**Talking-Head / Testimonial** (SaaS, course, service, B2B)
- Realism register: **face-forward, eye-contact, natural speech pacing**. Route to HeyGen (`heygen` or `heygen-agent`) when avatar required — **never try to generate talking faces via Veo/Seedance** (face morphing + lip desync).
- Camera: medium-close, eye-level, static or very slow dolly.
- Audio: primary voice at -6dB, room-tone floor, no music unless branded bed.
- Script: EXACT dialogue spoken (40–50 words, 3s hook). Emotion tag before each line.
- Banned: jump cuts mid-sentence, cinematic color grade, background activity competing with face.

**SaaS / UI Demo** (product walkthroughs, feature launches, app stores)
- Realism register: **crisp screen capture, cursor grammar, UI reveals**. Screen IS the subject.
- Camera: static canvas OR zoom-to-region OR picture-in-picture with presenter in corner.
- Audio: voiceover-led, optional keyboard clicks at -24dB, light motion-graphics stingers at scene changes.
- Beats: problem frame → open product → perform action → show result → CTA. 3–4s each.
- Banned: fake UI mocks (always use real screenshots user supplies), auto-generated logos, imagined button labels.

**Gameplay / Reaction** (games, interactive apps, entertainment)
- Realism register: **split-attention — real gameplay + real reaction face**. Split-screen or PiP.
- Camera: gameplay = in-engine capture (static), reaction = webcam-handheld with visible excitement.
- Audio: game audio + authentic reaction voiceover (gasps, "no way," "wait"), music ONLY if diegetic.
- Banned: staged reactions, fake gameplay mockups, generic game music overlay.

**Split-Screen / Before-After** (fitness, skincare, finance glow-ups, tool comparisons)
- Realism register: **visually matched compositions** — same angle, same framing, same lighting across both sides. The contrast is the entire creative.
- Camera: locked framing on both panels, zero motion mismatch.
- Audio: voiceover narrating the delta, ambient matched or absent.
- Banned: filters that fake the "after," different crops between panels, music telegraphing the reveal.

**Transformation Story** (UGC or hero, multi-day or multi-beat journey)
- Must include Evolution spec (lock #4). State 3 visible deltas in one paragraph before beats.
- Use wardrobe/setting change to cue time — never rely on text overlays unless approved.
- Close on the payoff beat, not a summary.

## Negative Anchor Library (paste verbatim per module)

- **UGC:** `studio lighting, ring lights, text overlays, cinematic camera moves, artificial bokeh, color grading filters, heavy post-processing, glam makeup, posed smiles, stock music`
- **Hero Product:** `handheld shake, phone-camera look, vlog aesthetic, casual framing, text overlays, lens-flare presets, dirty/cluttered backgrounds`
- **Talking-Head:** `jump cuts mid-sentence, background motion competing with face, cinematic color grade, uncanny avatar artifacts, hand morphing`
- **SaaS / UI Demo:** `fabricated UI elements, imagined button labels, generic stock logos, fake data that looks real, motion blur on text`
- **Gameplay / Reaction:** `staged reactions, fake gameplay footage, generic music overlay, cuts that hide gameplay moments`
- **Split-Screen:** `different crops between panels, filters on one side only, mismatched lighting, music telegraphing the reveal`
- **Universal (always append):** `distorted hands, morphing faces, inconsistent product color, floating limbs, extra fingers, text artifacts`

## Continuity Locks (multi-beat, multi-shot, batch)

When a prompt spans multiple beats OR a batch generates 3+ variations:

1. **Subject identity anchor** — single sentence describing person/product appears in shell AND top of every beat. Copy-paste, don't paraphrase.
2. **Wardrobe/packaging delta rule** — state exactly what's ALLOWED to change (outfit, setting, lighting) and what MUST stay fixed (face, skin tone, SKU, label). Models interpret silence as permission.
3. **Lighting arc** — beats span time-of-day (morning → day → golden hour) → spec each lighting explicitly. Never let the model interpolate.
4. **Reference image leash** (image-to-video / edit modes) — name the reference file and say `maintain exact product identity from reference: color, proportions, label copy, material finish`.

## Realism Gradient — pick ONE register per creative

| Register | Use for | Key tokens |
|---|---|---|
| **Raw UGC** | DTC staples, social-proof, relatable verticals | `handheld, phone-camera, real skin texture, no filter, natural light only` |
| **Polished UGC** | Premium DTC, wellness, apparel at mid-price | `natural light, slight stabilization, clean but not glossy, real textures` |
| **Hero Product** | Luxury, tech, premium packaged | `locked camera, controlled key light, macro texture, specular highlights` |
| **Cinematic Narrative** | Brand films, 30-60s anthems | `motion-controlled moves, designed lighting, shallow DOF intentional, color-graded` |
| **Screen-Native** | SaaS, apps, digital products | `UI-first, cursor grammar, graphic stingers, voiceover-led` |

**Never mix registers inside a single creative.** Raw UGC with cinematic dolly moves reads as fake and tanks CTR. Pick one, commit.

## Video Prompts — 6 Required Anchors (anti-artifact technical floor)

These apply UNDERNEATH the 7 locks and 1 module — they protect against model failure modes regardless of creative type. Every `productHook` or video description MUST include all 6:

1. **Camera motion** — exact: "slow smooth dolly-in," "static tripod," "gentle pan right." Never unspecified.
2. **Facial consistency** — "consistent facial features" + specific expression ("shy smile," "confident gaze"). Prevents face morphing.
3. **Hand anatomy** — "anatomically correct hands with fluid, stable movement" + specific gesture. Hands = #1 failure mode.
4. **Texture lock** — "fixed [fabric/material] textures, stable rendering." Name the specific material.
5. **Hair physics** — "gentle hair movement" or "minimal hair movement." Default = wild/unrealistic.
6. **Lighting + finish** — "warm golden hour lighting" (or specific) + "high-definition details, clean professional finish."

## Prompt Template (copy-fill for every video brief)

```
[Shell lock] {mode}. {aspect}. {duration}. {style family}.

[Subject lock] {specific physical/SKU description}. Same {subject} throughout — only {allowed variable} changes.

[Evolution spec — transformation only] Stage 1: {state}. Stage 2: {state}. Stage 3: {state}.

[Beat 1, 0–Xs — LABEL]
Setting: {where}. Lighting: {source + quality}. Wardrobe/packaging: {specifics}.
Camera: {angle + motion + lens feel}.
Action: {what subject does}.
Emotion: {facial/body state}.
Voiceover — {Speaker} ({emotion tag}): "{exact line}"
Audio: {ambient layer}.

[Beat 2, X–Ys — LABEL] (same structure)

[Beat N, closing — LABEL + freeze frame] (same structure)
Final frame: {subject + framing + light + focus}.

[6 technical anchors]
Camera motion: {...}. Facial consistency: consistent features, {expression}. Hands: anatomically correct, {gesture}. Texture: fixed {material}. Hair: {motion spec}. Lighting + finish: {...}.

[Continuity locks]
Character: {anchor sentence}. Allowed to change: {list}. Fixed: {list}.

[Style summary]
{comma-delimited adjective stack}.

[Audio directive]
Music: {none | spec}. Voiceover: {delivery direction}.

[No:]
{negative anchors from module library + universal set}
```

Write prompts in this EXACT order — locks first, creative flourish after.

## Video Actions (`mcp__merlin__video`)

| Action | Key params | When |
|---|---|---|
| `generate` | `mode` (product-showcase / talking-head / ugc), `script`, `productHook`, `duration`, `voiceStyle`, `referencesDir` | Full pipeline with QA, multi-format exports |
| `heygen-agent` | `prompt` (1–10,000 chars), optional `avatarId`/`voiceId`/`styleId`/`orientation`/`incognitoMode`/`callbackUrl` | User gives a natural-language idea; agent picks avatar/voice/style |

**How to pick between video paths:**
- **`heygen-agent`** — one-shot prompt → video. Agent picks everything. Fastest, lowest control.
- **`heygen`** (mode on `generate`) — Avatar IV with specific script + talking-head photo. More control.
- **`fal` / `veo` / `seedance`** — non-avatar video (product showcase, kinetic, generative). Use image-to-video with locked reference frame for transformations >15s.

HeyGen output → `results/video/YYYY-MM/<brand>/ad_<runID>/video.mp4`. Requires `heygenApiKey`.

## Voice (`mcp__merlin__voice`)

`clone` (`voiceSampleDir`, `voiceName`) · `list` · `delete` (`voiceId`) · `list-avatars` (HeyGen).

## Offer Construction (copy can't save a weak offer)

Before writing a single line of copy, score the **offer**. Copy amplifies offers; it doesn't rescue them.

### Hormozi Value Equation (score 0–100 per factor)

`Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Success) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)`

- **Dream outcome** — what they actually want (not what the product does). "Clear skin" not "20% niacinamide serum."
- **Perceived likelihood** — proof the outcome is real: testimonials with outcomes, before/afters, data, guarantees.
- **Time delay** — how fast they feel it. Faster = higher perceived value. Name the timeline.
- **Effort & sacrifice** — how much they must do / give up. Lower = higher perceived value.

Strong offers lift the numerator AND shrink the denominator simultaneously. Stack: core product + risk reversal (money-back, try-before-you-buy) + real urgency + bonuses that complement, not dilute.

### Eugene Schwartz — 5 Levels of Awareness (match copy to reader state)

| Level | Reader knows | Copy leads with |
|---|---|---|
| **Unaware** | Has a problem but can't articulate it | Story / pattern interrupt; name the feeling |
| **Problem-aware** | Names the problem, not solutions | Agitate problem, introduce category |
| **Solution-aware** | Knows solutions exist, hasn't chosen | Comparisons, "why [your mechanism] wins" |
| **Product-aware** | Knows your product, hasn't bought | Risk reversal, proof, specifics |
| **Most-aware** | Knows and wants it | Offer, deadline, discount, CTA |

**Cold Meta/TikTok traffic is Unaware / Problem-aware. Retargeting is Solution / Product-aware. Email list is Product / Most-aware.** Copy that leads with features to cold traffic fails because the reader has no frame. Copy that re-explains the problem to a warm list bores them.

### Frameworks (pick one per piece — don't mix)

- **PAS** (Problem-Agitate-Solve) — cold social, short-form video scripts, subject lines.
- **AIDA** (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action) — long-form landing pages, cold email.
- **PASTOR** (Problem-Amplify-Story-Transformation-Offer-Response) — sales pages, webinars.
- **4-P's** (Picture-Promise-Proof-Push) — email campaigns, paid social long copy.
- **Stefan Georgi RMBC** (Research-Mechanism-Brief-Copy) — VSLs, advertorials, long-form DR.

## Creative Performance Metrics (the real scoreboard)

Subjective quality scoring is directional. The actual measure is what the platform reports post-launch:

| Metric | Formula | Healthy (DTC video) | Unhealthy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hook rate** (3-second view rate) | 3s views / impressions | ≥30% | <20% = first frame isn't stopping scrolls |
| **Hold rate** | 15s views / 3s views | ≥50% | <30% = hook is baity; body doesn't deliver |
| **Thumbstop ratio** | 3s views / impressions, compared across creatives | top 20% vs account avg | flag bottom 20% for replacement |
| **CTR (link)** | link clicks / impressions | ≥1.5% Meta feed / ≥1.0% TikTok | <1.0% Meta feed = weak CTA or offer |
| **Cost per thumb-stop** | spend / 3s views | <$0.02 | >$0.05 = bad creative at any CPM |

**Beat structure for video hooks** (0–3s → 3–15s → 15–25s → final 2s):
- **0–3s — hook.** Stop the scroll. Pattern interrupt, question, dramatic visual, or bold claim. No brand logos, no slow pans.
- **3–15s — retention.** Deliver on the hook. Name the problem, show the mechanism, build tension. Hold rate is won or lost here.
- **15–25s — proof / offer.** Testimonial, before/after, demo, specific result with numbers.
- **Final 2s — CTA.** Single specific action. "Tap to shop" not "Learn more."

**Feedback loop:** after each optimize run, write top performers' hook archetype, module, and retention curve to `memory.md ## What Works`. Every brief pulls from that section — creative testing compounds only if winners are encoded back into the brief generator.

## Copy Quality Gate

Before shipping any written output — ad copy, email body, blog post, landing headline, social post, thread — score it 0–100 against a 7-expert panel. Target ≥90. Max 3 revision rounds, then ship best version with candid notes on remaining gaps.

**The 7 experts** (score each 0–100, then average):
1. Direct-response copywriter — does it sell? Is the offer clear? (reference Value Equation above)
2. Brand voice guardian — does it sound like this brand?
3. Conversion analyst — is the CTA single, specific, frictionless?
4. SEO strategist — keyword + intent match (skip for ad copy).
5. Skeptical founder — would the CEO approve this going out?
6. Audience persona match — does the target reader recognize themselves? Is the awareness level matched (Schwartz)?
7. **AI-writing detector — weighted 1.5×.** **AI-confidence ≥40% = automatic ship blocker** regardless of other scores. If a dedicated detector isn't available, apply the heuristic checklist below — any ≥3 banned-vocab hits or ≥2 humanizer patterns = blocking.

**Banned vocabulary** (−5 per instance, reject if ≥3 present): delve, tapestry, leverage, seamless, transformative, ecosystem, synergy, elevate, unlock, empower, journey (figurative), navigate (figurative), realm, landscape (figurative), harness, foster (figurative), testament, pivotal, paramount, crucial, bespoke (unless literally tailored), robust, comprehensive, holistic, meticulously, in today's fast-paced world, at the end of the day.

**Top humanizer patterns to reject:**
1. **Negation-definition**: "This isn't just X. It's Y." → rewrite as direct claim.
2. **Significance inflation**: "It's important to note that…" / "It's worth mentioning…" → cut.
3. **Tricolon clichés**: "faster, cheaper, better" → replace with one specific number.
4. **Em-dash decoration** when a comma or period would work.
5. **Hedged conclusions**: "ultimately," "in essence," "at the end of the day."
6. **Generic openers**: "In the ever-evolving world of…" → delete entire opener.

**Discipline:** scores must be honest. No padding to hit 90. Show every round's score in output — iteration transparency is the value, not a clean final number. After 3 rounds, ship best with one-line note on what still isn't perfect.

## Content Scoring (viral score)

For every generated blog, X/LinkedIn thread, short-form video script, social post, or newsletter section:

**Viral score = (Novelty × 0.4) + (Controversy × 0.3) + (Utility × 0.3)**, each factor 0–100.

- **Novelty** — is the angle fresh, or recycled take #47? Score harshly — most content is derivative.
- **Controversy** — is there a position someone could reasonably disagree with? Neutral = 0.
- **Utility** — can the reader do something concretely different tomorrow? Specifics raise the score.

**Thresholds:** ≥80 → publish priority · 60–79 → calendar filler · 40–59 → use sparingly · <40 → cut.

**Atomization** — every long-form source (blog, podcast, case study, call transcript, customer interview) produces 15–20 downstream assets: 3–5 short-form clips with hooks + timestamps · 2–3 X/LinkedIn threads (5–10 posts each, ≤280 chars per X post) · 1 LinkedIn article (800–1,200 words, story-driven) · 1 newsletter section with TL;DR + pull quotes · 3–5 quote cards (≤20 words each) · 1 SEO blog outline · 1 Shorts/TikTok script with hooks + B-roll cues.

**Dedup rule:** reject any asset with >70% semantic overlap vs. another asset in the same batch or vs. anything published in the last 30 days. Check `results/` and memory's Run Log before generating.

## Production Truth

- fal.ai cannot produce pixel-perfect logos or text — only use for lifestyle/hero imagery.
- Always use real logos (downloaded to `logo/logo.png`), real product photos (Shopify CDN), real brand colors (exact hex from `brand.md`).
- Brand colors come from website CSS custom properties (`--color-button`, `--color-foreground`, etc.) extracted at onboarding.
- Character consistency beyond ~8s is fragile in text-to-video — for transformations >15s, prefer image-to-video with a locked reference frame, or split into multiple clips stitched in post.
- HeyGen is the ONLY reliable path for spoken talking-head with lip-sync. Veo/Seedance for spoken human faces = face morphing + lip desync.
- Batch variation rule: when generating N variations, vary ONE dimension at a time (hook OR format OR setting) — never all three. Single-variable testing reads cleanly in the Promotion Gate.

## Hook archetypes

Every creative uses one: **curiosity-gap, pattern-interrupt, problem-agitation, POV, social-proof-frontload, skit, before-after, direct-address, voiceover-demo, testimonial-open.** Tag in `metadata.json`. QA rejects hooks <6/10 on attention pull.

## Content Action Reference (`mcp__merlin__content`)

| Action | Key params |
|---|---|
| `image` | `imagePrompt`, `imageFormat` (`both` / portrait / square), `referencesDir`, `skipSlack` (default true) |
| `batch` | `batchCount`, `mode`, `script`, `skipSlack` |
| `archive` | `archiveDays` |
| `blog-post` | `blogTitle`, `blogBody`, `blogTags`, `blogImage` (see `merlin-seo`) |
| `blog-list` | (none) |
| `competitor-scan` | `blogBody` (comma list of competitor names), `imageCount` (see `merlin-social`) |

## Images / Video Display

Include full file path on its own line (e.g. `results/img_20260403/image_1.jpg`). No backticks, no code blocks. App auto-renders `.jpg/.png/.webp/.mp4` inline.

## Routing hints

- "make / generate / create / shoot a video" → `video({action: "generate"})` or `heygen-agent`
- "make / generate an image / ad / photo" → `content({action: "image"})`
- "quick HeyGen video" / "one-shot video from a prompt" → `heygen-agent`
- "clone my voice" → `voice({action: "clone"})`
- "score this copy" / "is this AI-sounding" / "rewrite this" → Copy Quality Gate inline
- "viral score" / "will this land" → Content Scoring
- "batch 3 variations" → `content({action: "batch"})`

## Cross-references

- Promotion Gate (stat-test winners before scaling) → `merlin-ads`
- Blog publishing pipeline → `merlin-seo`
